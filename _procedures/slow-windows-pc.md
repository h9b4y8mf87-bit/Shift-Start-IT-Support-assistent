## Steps
1. Confirm whether the issue affects one app or the whole PC and whether it started after an update.

2. Capture uptime, free space and top resource consumers.

{% capture kb_command_1 %}
Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object LastBootUpTime,FreePhysicalMemory,TotalVisibleMemorySize
Get-Volume | Select-Object DriveLetter,SizeRemaining,Size
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 Name,CPU,WorkingSet
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="PowerShell" command=kb_command_1 %}

3. Restart normally if uptime is excessive or a restart is pending, after saving user work.

4. Review Task Manager Startup apps and disable only non-essential approved items.

5. Check storage health and endpoint security scan status. Do not use registry cleaners.

<div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The measured bottleneck is identified and performance improves after the smallest approved change.</div>

## Verification
Repeat the slow task and compare opening time or response time with the original observation.
