## Purpose and scope
Use this procedure for an approved request to add or remove a user, computer, service account or nested group from a security group. It covers:

- On-premises Active Directory groups.
- Microsoft Entra ID assigned-membership groups.
- Hybrid groups where the source of authority must be identified before making a change.

Do not use this procedure to bypass access governance, alter a dynamic membership rule, change a privileged group without the required privileged-access process, or modify a group whose ownership and business purpose cannot be confirmed.

## Safety and stop conditions
Stop and escalate before making a change when any of the following applies:

- The request has no valid approval, has conflicting approvals, or names the wrong user, group or environment.
- The group grants administrative, security, finance, payroll, HR, production, source-code, customer-data or other sensitive access.
- The group is role-assignable, managed through Privileged Identity Management, controlled by an access package, or subject to an access review.
- The group uses dynamic membership. Direct member changes are not the correct remediation for a dynamic group.
- The group is synchronised and the current directory is not the source of authority.
- Removal may interrupt an active service account, scheduled task, application pool, integration or emergency-access account.
- The requested change would create circular nesting, excessive privilege or access outside the approved scope.

## Information and evidence to capture
Record all of the following in the ticket before changing membership:

- Request or change-record number and approver.
- User or object display name, sign-in name, employee or asset identifier and immutable object ID where available.
- Exact group display name, distinguished name or object ID.
- Group owner, business purpose, source of authority and membership type.
- Whether the group is privileged, role-assignable, dynamic, synchronised, nested or licence-bearing.
- Current direct membership and, when relevant, effective or transitive membership.
- The specific access expected after the change and the business application or resource used for verification.

## Procedure
1. **Validate the request and resolve the exact objects.** Confirm that the approved request identifies one unambiguous principal and one unambiguous group. Do not rely on display name alone when duplicates exist.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The principal and group are uniquely identified, the approval scope matches the proposed change, and the source directory is known.</div>

2. **Inspect group properties before changing anything.** Confirm group scope and category in Active Directory, or membership type, synchronisation state and role-assignable status in Microsoft Entra ID.

{% capture ad_group_properties %}
$Group = Get-ADGroup -Identity "GROUP_SAM_OR_DN" -Properties GroupCategory,GroupScope,ManagedBy,member
$Group | Select-Object Name,SamAccountName,GroupCategory,GroupScope,ManagedBy,DistinguishedName
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="Active Directory group properties" command=ad_group_properties %}

{% capture entra_group_properties %}
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "GroupMember.Read.All","Group.Read.All"
$Group = Get-MgGroup -Filter "displayName eq 'GROUP_DISPLAY_NAME'" -Property Id,DisplayName,SecurityEnabled,GroupTypes,MembershipRule,OnPremisesSyncEnabled,IsAssignableToRole
$Group | Select-Object Id,DisplayName,SecurityEnabled,GroupTypes,MembershipRule,OnPremisesSyncEnabled,IsAssignableToRole
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="Microsoft Entra group properties" command=entra_group_properties %}

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> You know whether the group can be changed directly in the current directory and whether additional privileged or governance approval is required.</div>

3. **Capture before-state membership.** Record both the target principal's current groups and the target group's direct members. Use transitive checks only as supporting evidence; a user may have effective access through nesting even when they are not a direct member.

{% capture ad_membership_evidence %}
Get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership -Identity "USER_OR_OBJECT" |
  Sort-Object Name |
  Select-Object Name,SamAccountName,GroupCategory,GroupScope

Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "GROUP_SAM_OR_DN" -Recursive:$false |
  Sort-Object Name |
  Select-Object Name,SamAccountName,ObjectClass,DistinguishedName
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="Active Directory before-state evidence" command=ad_membership_evidence %}

{% capture entra_membership_evidence %}
$GroupId = "GROUP_OBJECT_ID"
Get-MgGroupMember -GroupId $GroupId -All |
  Select-Object Id,AdditionalProperties
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="Microsoft Entra direct members" command=entra_membership_evidence %}

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The ticket contains a reproducible before-state showing whether the principal is already a direct member, only an indirect member, or not a member.</div>

4. **Confirm the change is appropriate for the group type.** For a dynamic group, validate or correct the membership rule through the approved group-management process instead of adding or removing a direct member. For a synchronised group, make the change in the source directory. For a role-assignable or PIM-managed group, use the privileged-governance workflow.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The proposed action is being performed in the authoritative system with the correct governance controls.</div>

5. **Preview the on-premises Active Directory change.** Use `-WhatIf` first and review the target group and principal returned by the command.

{% capture ad_change_preview %}
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "GROUP_SAM_OR_DN" -Members "USER_OR_OBJECT" -WhatIf
Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity "GROUP_SAM_OR_DN" -Members "USER_OR_OBJECT" -WhatIf
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="Preview the approved AD change" command=ad_change_preview %}

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The preview names only the approved group and principal and does not reveal an unexpected nested or similarly named object.</div>

6. **Apply only the approved change.** Run one of the following commands, not both. Retain confirmation for removals unless the organisation's controlled automation explicitly handles confirmation and audit logging.

{% capture ad_change_apply %}
# Approved addition
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "GROUP_SAM_OR_DN" -Members "USER_OR_OBJECT" -Confirm

# Approved removal
Remove-ADGroupMember -Identity "GROUP_SAM_OR_DN" -Members "USER_OR_OBJECT" -Confirm
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="Apply the approved Active Directory change" command=ad_change_apply %}

For a Microsoft Entra assigned-membership group, use an approved Graph session with the least privilege required. Replace the placeholders with immutable object IDs.

{% capture entra_change_apply %}
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "GroupMember.ReadWrite.All"
$GroupId = "GROUP_OBJECT_ID"
$DirectoryObjectId = "MEMBER_OBJECT_ID"

# Approved addition
$params = @{ "@odata.id" = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directoryObjects/$DirectoryObjectId" }
New-MgGroupMemberByRef -GroupId $GroupId -BodyParameter $params

# Approved removal
Remove-MgGroupMemberByRef -GroupId $GroupId -DirectoryObjectId $DirectoryObjectId -Confirm
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="Apply the approved Microsoft Entra change" command=entra_change_apply %}

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> Exactly one approved membership change is accepted by the authoritative directory without broadening the request.</div>

7. **Capture the after-state and compare it with the before-state.** Repeat the direct membership query and save the result in the ticket. Confirm that no unrelated member was added or removed.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The group contains the intended principal after an addition, or no longer contains it after a removal, with no unauthorised side effects.</div>

8. **Allow directory convergence and refresh the user's token.** Replication, synchronisation and application-side authorisation caches may delay access changes. Use a new sign-in session or approved token-refresh method. Do not repeatedly alter membership to compensate for normal convergence time.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The authoritative directory and consuming application show a consistent membership state.</div>

9. **Verify the original business task.** Test the exact resource named in the request. Confirm both positive access and least privilege: the user can perform the approved task but does not receive broader access.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The approved business function works and the effective privilege matches the request.</div>

10. **Document and close.** Record the command or portal action, before-and-after evidence, object IDs, timestamps, directory source, approver, token-refresh method, test result and any delay or exception. Link related change, access-review, PIM or problem records.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> Another technician or auditor can reconstruct who approved the change, what changed, where it changed and how access was verified.</div>

## Rollback
- For an incorrect addition, remove the same principal from the same group after confirming that rollback is authorised.
- For an incorrect removal, re-add the same principal only when the prior membership was captured and restoration is authorised.
- Do not attempt rollback in the wrong directory for synchronised groups.
- If a privileged group change may have been unauthorised, stop normal remediation and invoke the security incident process.

## Verification checklist
- [ ] Requester, approver, principal and group were uniquely verified.
- [ ] Group type, source of authority and privileged status were checked.
- [ ] Before-state direct membership evidence was captured.
- [ ] Only the approved addition or removal was performed.
- [ ] After-state membership evidence was captured.
- [ ] Replication, synchronisation or token refresh was allowed to complete.
- [ ] The original business task was tested.
- [ ] Effective access does not exceed the approved scope.
- [ ] Ticket notes contain object IDs, timestamps, commands, results and rollback information.
