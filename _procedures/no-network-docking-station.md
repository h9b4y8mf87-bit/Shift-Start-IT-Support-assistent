## Diagnostic Steps
1. Confirm whether Wi-Fi works on the same laptop.
2. Test the Ethernet cable and wall port with a known-good device.
3. Power-cycle the dock by disconnecting the laptop, dock power and peripherals for 30 seconds, then reconnect dock power followed by USB-C.
4. Inspect adapter state and IP configuration.

{% capture kb_command_1 %}
Get-NetAdapter | Sort-Object Status,Name | Format-Table Name,InterfaceDescription,Status,LinkSpeed
Get-NetIPConfiguration
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="PowerShell" command=kb_command_1 %}

5. Identify the exact dock Ethernet adapter before making any adapter-state change.

## Remediation Steps
1. Disable and re-enable only the identified dock Ethernet adapter.

{% capture kb_command_2 %}
Disable-NetAdapter -Name 'Ethernet' -Confirm:$false
Start-Sleep 3
Enable-NetAdapter -Name 'Ethernet' -Confirm:$false
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="PowerShell (Admin)" command=kb_command_2 %}

2. Install only approved laptop, dock and NIC driver or firmware updates.
3. Reconnect the dock and confirm the adapter receives the approved IP, gateway and DNS configuration.

## Rollback Steps
1. If the adapter reset does not help, ensure the adapter is left enabled.
2. If an approved driver change causes regression, use the organisation's approved driver rollback method.
3. Do not downgrade dock firmware unless the vendor and organisational change process explicitly support it.

## Verification Steps
1. Disable Wi-Fi temporarily.
2. Confirm the dock Ethernet adapter is Up.
3. Confirm gateway and DNS reachability.
4. Open an internal resource over dock Ethernet.
5. Monitor the link long enough to confirm it remains stable.

## Escalation Path
1. Escalate to Desktop Support if the dock adapter is absent or firmware/driver remediation fails.
2. Escalate to Network Operations if a known-good device also fails on the same network port.
3. Include laptop and dock models, serials, cable/port tests, adapter state, driver version and whether another laptop works on the same dock.
