## Steps
1. Capture who, what, where, when and impact. Ask what changed immediately before the issue.

2. Reproduce once without repeating risky actions. Record exact wording and timestamps.

3. Gather baseline system information.

{% capture kb_command_1 %}
$env:COMPUTERNAME
whoami
Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object Caption,Version,LastBootUpTime
Get-Volume | Select-Object DriveLetter,FileSystemLabel,SizeRemaining,Size
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="PowerShell" command=kb_command_1 %}

4. Isolate the layer:
   - Another user on the same device tests account scope.
   - The same user on another device tests device scope.
   - Another application tests application scope.
   - Another network tests network scope.

5. Apply only the smallest reversible fix supported by evidence.

<div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The issue is assigned to a clear layer with evidence supporting the next action.</div>

## Verification
Repeat the user's original action and confirm the result survives a normal application restart.
