## Steps
1. Confirm the user is on the corporate network or connected VPN.

2. List current mappings and test the file server.

{% capture kb_command_1 %}
net use
nslookup fileserver.example.com
ping fileserver.example.com
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="cmd" label="Command Prompt" command=kb_command_1 %}

3. Open the approved UNC path directly in File Explorer. If access is denied, do not repeatedly reconnect with alternate credentials.

4. Remove only the stale drive letter and recreate it.

{% capture kb_command_2 %}
net use H: /delete
net use H: \\fileserver.example.com\department /persistent:yes
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="cmd" label="Command Prompt" command=kb_command_2 %}

<div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The approved share opens through its UNC path and the drive letter reconnects without a credential prompt.</div>

## Verification
Open, create and delete an authorised test file, then sign out/in and confirm the mapping persists.
