## Steps
1. Confirm the user can browse a public website without the VPN and that airplane mode is off.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> Basic internet works. If it does not, troubleshoot the local connection first.</div>

2. Confirm date and time are correct. Authentication may fail when the clock is significantly wrong.

{% capture kb_command_1 %}
Get-Date; w32tm /query /status
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="PowerShell" command=kb_command_1 %}

3. Resolve and test the configured VPN gateway.

{% capture kb_command_2 %}
Resolve-DnsName vpn.example.com; Test-NetConnection vpn.example.com -Port 443
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="PowerShell" command=kb_command_2 %}

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> DNS returns the approved gateway and the required port is reachable.</div>

4. Fully exit the client, restart its approved Windows service, then reconnect. Do not clear certificates or profiles unless your product runbook requires it.

5. Test with a mobile hotspot. Success on the hotspot suggests a local router, ISP or restrictive guest network issue.

## Verification
Connect the VPN, open one internal service and confirm the assigned corporate network route.
