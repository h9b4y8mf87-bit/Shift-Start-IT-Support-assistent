## Before you begin
Confirm the caller's identity using the organisation's approved verification process. Never ask the user to disclose an existing password or MFA code.

## Steps
1. Confirm the exact username, affected service and error message.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> You know whether the issue is a forgotten password, expired password, disabled account or repeated lockout.</div>

2. Check the account state using the approved administration console. Where RSAT is authorised, gather read-only evidence:

{% capture kb_command_1 %}
Get-ADUser -Identity username -Properties LockedOut,Enabled,PasswordExpired,LastBadPasswordAttempt | Select-Object SamAccountName,Enabled,LockedOut,PasswordExpired,LastBadPasswordAttempt
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="PowerShell" command=kb_command_1 %}

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The account state explains the sign-in failure or indicates that another system must be checked.</div>

3. Unlock or reset the account only after identity verification. Require a password change at next sign-in where policy requires it.

4. Ask the user to sign in once on a trusted corporate device. Then update saved credentials on phones, Outlook, VPN clients and mapped drives.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The user signs in successfully and the account does not immediately lock again.</div>

## Verification
Confirm access to the original service and check that no new bad-password attempts appear for five minutes.
