  Check physical mute, select the correct input in Teams, confirm Windows microphone privacy permission and test the
  same device outside Teams before changing drivers.

  Escalate to Collaboration Support or Desktop Support if the microphone fails outside Teams, the audio endpoint is
  absent or unhealthy, privacy policy blocks access, or the device fails on multiple systems.
risk_model: impact-v1
risk_basis: Medium impact - meeting audio is degraded while chat, phone audio or another approved device may provide a workaround.

## Diagnostic Steps
1. Check physical mute controls and reconnect the headset directly rather than through an untested hub.
2. In Teams device settings, select the intended microphone and run a test call.
3. In Windows Settings > Privacy & security > Microphone, confirm microphone access and desktop-app access comply with policy.
4. Test the microphone in Sound Recorder. If it fails there, treat the fault as Windows, driver or hardware rather than Teams-specific.
5. Review detected audio endpoints.

{% capture kb_command_1 %}
Get-PnpDevice -Class AudioEndpoint | Select-Object Status,FriendlyName,InstanceId
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="PowerShell" command=kb_command_1 %}

## Remediation Steps
1. Select the correct Teams input device.
2. Enable the required Windows privacy permission where organisational policy allows it.
3. Reconnect the headset or move it to a known-good direct USB/audio connection.
4. Use approved driver remediation only if Windows does not detect the intended audio endpoint correctly.

## Rollback Steps
1. Restore the previous default audio device if changing it causes another required application to fail.
2. Reverse only the privacy or device-selection change made during this procedure if it produces an unexpected effect.
3. Do not disable organisation-managed privacy controls to work around policy.

## Verification Steps
1. Record clear audio in Sound Recorder.
2. Complete a Teams test call.
3. Confirm Teams keeps the intended input selected.
4. Confirm the microphone does not switch unexpectedly during a second test.

## Escalation Path
1. Escalate to Collaboration Support if Teams alone fails despite a successful Windows recording test.
2. Escalate to Desktop Support if the microphone fails outside Teams or the audio endpoint is absent.
3. Include headset model, connection type, Teams version, Windows input result, privacy setting and cross-device test result.
