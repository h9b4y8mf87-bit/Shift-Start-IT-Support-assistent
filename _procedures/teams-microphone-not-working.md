## Steps
1. Check physical mute controls and reconnect the headset directly rather than through an untested hub.

2. In Teams device settings, select the intended microphone and run a test call.

3. In Windows Settings > Privacy & security > Microphone, allow microphone access and desktop app access according to policy.

4. Test in Sound Recorder. If it fails there, the issue is below Teams.

5. Review detected audio devices.

{% capture kb_command_1 %}
Get-PnpDevice -Class AudioEndpoint | Select-Object Status,FriendlyName,InstanceId
{% endcapture %}
{% include command.html shell="powershell" label="PowerShell" command=kb_command_1 %}

<div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> Windows and Teams both detect the intended microphone and record clear input.</div>

## Verification
Complete a Teams test call and confirm clear input without switching devices automatically.
