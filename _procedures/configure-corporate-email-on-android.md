## Purpose and scope
Use this runbook for **configure corporate email on android** in a managed enterprise environment. It covers intake, evidence, safe diagnosis, remediation, verification, documentation and escalation. It does not replace organisation-specific security, change, safety, privacy, regulatory or vendor procedures.

## Preconditions and authorisation
- Verify the requester, affected user, asset and business service.
- Confirm that the requested action is permitted for your support role.
- Protect unsaved work and business data before restarts, profile resets, re-enrolment, removal, wipe, restore or replacement actions.
- Use named administrative accounts and approved privileged-access workflows. Never request or record a user's password or MFA code.
- Stop when there is a safety risk, suspected security incident, legal hold, active major incident, unsupported device, data-loss risk or action outside your authority.

## Information and evidence to capture
- User, department, contact method, location and working hours.
- Device name, asset tag, serial number, operating system, network and management status where applicable.
- Exact error text, error code, screenshot, timestamp and timezone.
- Scope: one user, one device, one location, a group, or the whole service.
- Last known working time, recent changes and whether another user or device is affected.
- Business process blocked, workaround availability, urgency and deadline.

## Scenario-specific diagnostic and remediation plan

### Targeted checks
- Test webmail, check service health, quota, licence, connectivity, profile/cache and message-specific factors.
- Capture send/receive error, message trace details and exact time.

### Targeted remediation sequence
1. Repair the local profile/cache or correct approved mailbox/permission state.
2. Use message trace or service escalation for server-side delivery issues.

### Scenario-specific success criterion
The user sends, receives, searches or opens the required message successfully.


## Procedure
1. **Confirm the report and reproduce safely.** Ask the user to demonstrate the original task or reproduce it with non-sensitive test data. Do not repeatedly trigger lockouts, failed jobs, duplicate transactions or destructive actions.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The ticket contains a precise, reproducible statement of the failure and its business impact.</div>

2. **Determine scope and priority.** Compare another user, device, location or service path where safe. Check monitoring, service-health notices, known errors, major incidents and recent changes.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The issue is correctly classified as local, user-specific, device-specific, site-specific, service-wide or a standard request.</div>

3. **Protect data and establish a rollback point.** Save work, record current settings and export or back up configuration where supported. Obtain approval before actions that can interrupt service or remove data.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> Current state and recovery options are documented before any material change.</div>

4. **Run non-destructive diagnostics.** Review MDM enrolment, ownership, compliance, work profile, certificate, application assignment, OS version and last successful device check-in.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> Evidence identifies the failing layer or eliminates likely causes without changing production state.</div>

5. **Apply the primary approved remediation.** Refresh the management profile or work account and correct the approved configuration without removing personal data.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The affected component returns to a supported, known-good state with minimal user or service disruption.</div>

6. **Re-test the original task.** Repeat the exact business action using the same account, device, network and data path. Also test a controlled alternative where useful.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The original failure is resolved or the remaining fault is narrowed to a specific dependency.</div>

7. **Apply secondary remediation only when justified.** Re-enrol or selectively wipe corporate data only after backup, ownership and authorisation requirements are confirmed.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> Any deeper change follows an approved runbook, is reversible where possible and is fully recorded.</div>

8. **Validate security, management and compliance.** Confirm encryption, endpoint protection, identity policy, management check-in, logging, patch level and access controls remain healthy where relevant.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> Recovery has not created a security, compliance, licensing or manageability gap.</div>

9. **Complete end-to-end verification.** The device checks in to MDM, is compliant and can access the required corporate service.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> The user or service owner confirms the business task is restored and monitoring remains stable.</div>

10. **Document and close correctly.** Record the cause or best evidence, every command and change, before-and-after results, user confirmation, linked problem/change/vendor records, assets involved and follow-up actions. Do not close while a workaround is unowned or monitoring is still unstable.

   <div class="expected"><strong>Expected result:</strong> Another technician can reconstruct the incident, continue the work or audit the decision trail from the ticket alone.</div>

## Rollback and stop conditions
- Roll back the last change if service worsens, a new error appears or verification fails.
- Stop immediately for electrical, battery, overheating, liquid, smoke, physical-security or personal-safety risk.
- Stop and invoke the security process for suspected compromise, malware, phishing, data exposure or unauthorised access.
- Stop before deleting profiles, wiping devices, resetting production services, restoring over live data, changing network/security policy or bypassing controls without approval.

## Evidence required for escalation
- Ticket priority and business impact.
- Exact reproduction steps and result.
- Affected and unaffected comparison points.
- Diagnostic outputs and relevant logs with timestamps.
- Screenshots or error codes with sensitive data redacted.
- Recent changes, updates, deployments or environmental differences.
- Actions attempted, outcomes and rollback performed.
- Current workaround and user availability for testing.

## Verification checklist
- [ ] Original business task succeeds.
- [ ] No related alert, error, lockout or failed job is recurring.
- [ ] Security and management controls remain active.
- [ ] User or service owner confirms recovery.
- [ ] Ticket evidence and categorisation are complete.
- [ ] Follow-up problem, change, vendor or knowledge work is linked.
